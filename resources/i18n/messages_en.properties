Organic extraction is often used in laboratories because it is cheap, and it yields large quantities of pure DNA.
dna.extraction.paragraph4=<strong class="btn btn-warning  font-weight-bold">Chelex extraction</strong> method involves adding the Chelex resin to the sample, boiling the solution, then vortexing and centrifuging it. The cellular materials bind to the Chelex beads, while the DNA is available in the supernatant (upper leyer of solution acfter centrifugating). <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Butler JM (2005). 'Forensic DNA typing: biology, technology and genetics of STR markers' (2nd edition). Amsterdam: Elsevier Academic Press" href="#extraction">[7b]</a> The Chelex method is much faster and simpler than organic extraction, and it only requires one tube, which decreases the risk of DNA contamination but it yealds much lower quantity of DNA.
dna.extraction.paragraph5=<strong class="btn btn-warning font-weight-bold">Solid phase extraction</strong> such as using a spin-column based extraction method takes advantage of the fact that DNA binds to silica gel. The sample containing DNA is added to a column containing a silica gel or silica beads and chaotropic salts.

This exposes the phosphate residues so they are available for adsorption. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Li, Richard (11 March 2015).

dna.banding.title=Giemsa staining - G banding
dna.banding.paragraph1=Before chromosomes can be stained using G banding technique we have to cultivate cells from which we will get chromosomes in condensed state. Sample cells can be any somatic cell (peripheral blood, bone marrow, epithelial cells etc.). Cell culture involves 24 h or 48 h incubation at 37&#176;C in RPMI 1640 medium, enriched with 25% fetal bovine serum and 0.002M L-glutamine. Cultivation of cells sample is done in nutrient medium and then their cell division cycles are stopped and after that chromosomes are stained. Chromosomes are captured in metaphase of mitosis (cell division) by using some cytostatic like colchicine  or colcemide.
dna.banding.paragraph2=G banding or Giemsa banding is a technique used in cytogenetics to produce a visible karyotype (group of all chromosomes) by staining condensed chromosomes. The preparations are stained with a 2% solution of Giemsa in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 3 minutes. It is useful for identifying genetic diseases through the photographic representation of the entire chromosome complement. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Speicher, Michael R. and Nigel P. Carter. 'The New Cytogenetics: Blurring the Boundaries with Molecular Biology.' Nature Reviews Genetics, Vol 6.

Heterochromatic regions, which tend to be rich with adenine and thymine (AT-rich) DNA and relatively gene-poor, stain more darkly in G-banding. In contrast, less condensed chromatin (Euchromatin)\u2014which tends to be rich with guanine and cytosine (GC-rich) and more transcriptionally active\u2014incorporates less Giemsa stain, and these regions appear as light bands in G-banding. The pattern of bands are numbered on each arm of the chromosome from the centromere to the telomere. This numbering system allows any band on the chromosome to be identified and described precisely. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Nussbaum, Robert; McInnes, Roderick; Willard, Huntington (2015).

fish.title=Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
fish.paragraph1=Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of a nucleic acid sequence with a high degree of sequence complementarity. In biology, a probe is a single strand of DNA or RNA that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence of interest. FISH was developed by biomedical researchers in the early 1980s <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Langer-Safer, P. R.; Levine, M.; Ward, D. C. (1982). 'Immunological method for mapping genes on Drosophila polytene chromosomes'. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" href="#fish">[10]</a> to detect and localize the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences on chromosomes. 
fish.paragraph2=First, a probe is constructed. The probe must be large enough to hybridize specifically with its target but not so large as to impede the hybridization process. The probe is tagged directly with fluorophores, with targets for antibodies or with biotin. Tagging can be done in various ways, such as nick translation, or Polymerase chain reaction using tagged nucleotides. Then, an interphase or metaphase chromosome preparation is produced. The chromosomes are firmly attached to a substrate, usually glass. Repetitive DNA sequences must be blocked by adding short fragments of DNA to the sample. The probe is then applied to the chromosome DNA and incubated for approximately 12 hours while hybridizing. Several wash steps remove all unhybridized or partially hybridized probes. The results are then visualized and quantified using a microscope that is capable of exciting the dye and recording images. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Wikipedia: Fluorescent in situ hybridization" href="#fish">[10]</a>

fish.paragraph3=Molecular hybridization between complementary DNA sequences has been used to develop a new technology allowing the visualization of biological material at a scale that lies between the microscopic and the molecular scale, inaccessible to microscopic visualization. Each cellular or sub-cellular structure visible with the microscope and containing a nucleic acid molecule (chromosome, nucleus or ribosome) can be treated in situ after fixation on a slide that makes the nucleic acid molecule (RNA or DNA) accessible for a specific fluorochrome-carrying probe. The fixation of the fluorescence shows that the specific sequence is present and allows its localization. The absence of fluorescence shows that the sequence is absent. FISH brings an important complementary technique to the cytogenetic or genetic analysis because it gives information on the chromosome localization of a sequence, whether it has been deleted or translocated. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Diagnostic Techniques in Genetics, Jean-Louis Serre, Isabelle Heath, Simon Heath, Wiley (23 October, 2006)" href="#technics">[6]</a>

pcr.title=Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
pcr.paragraph1=Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail. PCR was invented in 1984 by the American biochemist Kary Mullis at Cetus Corporation. It is fundamental to much of genetic testing including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents. Using PCR, copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified in a series of cycles of temperature changes. PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical laboratory and clinical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and criminal forensics.<a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Saiki, R.; Scharf, S.; Faloona, F.; Mullis, K.; Horn, G.; Erlich, H.; Arnheim, N.

pcr.steps= Steps common to most PCR methods
pcr.paragraph6=<span class="bg-warning p-1 rounded">Denaturation:</span> This step is the first regular cycling event and consists of heating the reaction chamber to 94-98&#176;C (201-208&#176;F) for 20\u201330 seconds. This causes DNA melting, or denaturation, of the double-stranded DNA template by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, yielding two single-stranded DNA molecules.
pcr.paragraph7=<span class="bg-warning p-1 rounded">Annealing:</span> the reaction temperature is lowered to 50\u201365\u00A0&#176;C (122\u2013149&#176;F) for 20\u201340 seconds, allowing annealing of the primers to each of the single-stranded DNA templates. Two different primers are typically included in the reaction mixture: one for each of the two single-stranded complements containing the target region. The primers are single-stranded sequences themselves, but are much shorter than the length of the target region. The temperature must be low enough to allow for hybridization of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific.
pcr.paragraph8=<span class="bg-warning p-1 rounded">Extension:</span> The temperature at this step depends on the DNA polymerase used. The optimum activity temperature for the thermostable DNA polymerase of Taq polymerase is approximately 75-80-&#176;C (167-176&#176;F), <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM (1976).

PCR Methods and Applications. 2 (4): 275-287." href="#pcr">[14h]</a> though a temperature of 72&#176;C (162&#176;F) is commonly used with this enzyme. In this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding free dNTPs from the reaction mixture that is complementary to the template in the 5'-to-3' direction, condensing the 5'-phosphate group of the dNTPs with the 3'-hydroxy group at the end of the nascent (elongating) DNA strand. 
pcr.paragraph9=The processes of denaturation, annealing and elongation constitute a single cycle. Multiple cycles are required to amplify the DNA target to millions of copies. To check whether the PCR successfully generated the anticipated DNA target region (also sometimes referred to as the amplimer or amplicon), agarose gel electrophoresis may be employed for size separation of the PCR products. The size of the PCR products is determined by comparison with a DNA ladder, a molecular weight marker which contains DNA fragments of known sizes, which runs on the gel alongside the PCR products.

The term was coined by the german scientist von Waldeyer-Hartz, referring to the term chromatin, which was itself introduced by Walther Flemming, who discovered cell division. Some of the early karyological terms have become outdated. For example, Chromatin (Flemming 1880) and Chromosome (Waldeyer 1888), both ascribe color to a non-colored state.
left.upper.bottom.column=A chromosome is a part of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism.

karyotype.paragraph4=Karyogram is microphotographic representation of karyotype in which chromosome pairs are photographed, cut and rearranged according to their size and centromere position. 
karyotype.paragraph5=Karyotypes can be used for many purposes, such as to study chromosomal aberrations, cellular function, taxonomic relationships, medicine and to gather information about past evolutionary events (karyosystematics). <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Wikipedia: Karyotype" href="#karyotype">[15]</a>

right.upper.top.column.link=Chromosomes
right.upper.bottom.column=Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Antonin W, Neumann H (June 2016).

browse.first.p=The human chromosomes are numbered from 1 to 22, with two additional chromosomes called X and Y. Chromosomes 1\u201322 occur as two copies in every somatic cell. The X chromosome occurs as two copies in every female somatic cell, but only once in every male somatic cell. The Y chromosome occurs only once in every male somatic cell. Thus, the sex chromosomes in males are XY, and the sex chromosomes in females are XX. Altogether, human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). During mitosis, the genome condenses to form chromosomes that can be seen using a light microscope. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Tom Brody Ph.D. 'Hemathological cancers in Clinical trials', (Second Edition), 2016." href="#science">[3]</a>
browse.last.p=In a point in the cell cycle, that is, during metaphase, each of the chromosomes can be seen to have two arms, the p arm and the q arm. The letter p refers to the short arm, while q refers to the long arm. Within each arm, numbers are assigned to large areas called regions, and another set of numbers is used to refer to bands within the regions. Numbering starts from the centromere, and increases as one moves towards the tip of each arm. To provide an example, the term \u201C14q32\u201D refers to the second band in the third region of the q arm of chromosome 14. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Tom Brody Ph.D. 'Hemathological cancers in Clinical trials', (Second Edition), 2016." href="#science">[3]</a>

dna.title=Structure of DNA molecule
dna.text.upper=Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P (2014).

Archived from the original on 5 January 2017." href="#wikidna">[2a]</a>
dna.text.lower=Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phospho-diester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine (in RNA the thymine base is substituted by Uracil [U]) and cytosine and the purines are adenine and guanine. Unlike DNA molecule the RNA molecule is single stranded.

methodology.first.paragraph=Until 1920, the methodology commonly used for chromosomal analysis was based on tissue fixation in Carnoy-Flemming solution, preparation of microtomic sections by paraffin process, and staining the preparations with iron hematoxylin. Many of these chromosomal analyzes were performed on testicular tissue taken from patients with tuberculosis of the epididymis or from executed criminals. Therefore, it seems likely that the processing of these tissues by fixation, dehydration, paraffining, and high temperatures as well as posthumous changes, played an important role in modulating the variability of the results of chromosomal analysis. These methods provided insight into "mitotic figures", with a significant overlap of chromosomes in the dense metaphase plate and a low level of differentiation of their morphology. It is therefore not surprising that scientists of the time had different ideas about the number of human chromosomes. In 1955, Tjio and Levan published a paper with the exact number of human chromosomes (2n = 46) based on the culture of embryonic lung cells.
methodology.second.paragraph=During the second half of the 20th century, in less than 50 years, there have been two revolutions in biology one in protein biochemistry followed by one in molecular genetics with major repercussions both for fundamental research and medical applications. The development of protein biochemistry (at the end of the 1950s) has led to the purification of many proteins followed by the study using crystallography of their three-dimensional structure and, in parallel with this, their sequencing (identification of the linking of amino acids). <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Diagnostic Techniques in Genetics, Jean-Louis Serre, Isabelle Heath, Simon Heath, Wiley (23 October, 2006)" href="#technics">[6]</a>
methodology.third.paragraph=The consequences of the second revolution \u2013 in molecular genetics \u2013 have been more important in the domain of fundamental research than in its applications, simply because it gives direct access to the genes which direct biological phenomenon whereas before it was only possible, at best, to access their products or just the phenotypic perturbations of the phenomena resulting from mutations. Molecular genetics has allowed the cloning of genes, their sequencing and, above all, the ability to isolate them in vitro, in vectors, to modify them in a targeted manner, and to reintroduce them into cells or organisms to study, in a controlled manner, the way in which they control one or other aspect of a phenomenon. Genetics, in becoming molecular, has very rapidly become an integral part of most biological fields, not only due to its power to dissect a biological phenomenon but also because of its increasing ability to unify disciplines which had previously appeared different or unrelated. <a class="bracket" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Diagnostic Techniques in Genetics, Jean-Louis Serre, Isabelle Heath, Simon Heath, Wiley (23 October, 2006)" href="#technics">[6]</a>
methodology.fourth.paragraph=For diagnosis, molecular biologists mostly study and manipulate DNA, but RNA can also be studied, for example in virology where the genomes of many viruses are made of RNA. There are several different divisions of the analysis and testing methods of human chromosomes themselves. Several methods that fall into the domain of cytogenetics and molecular genetics will be briefly described on this site. These methods are as follows:
