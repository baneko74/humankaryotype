left.title=History fact
left.upper.top.column=The word chromosome comes from the Greek word (chroma, "colour") and (soma, "body"), describing their strong staining by particular dyes. The term was coined by the german scientist von Waldeyer-Hartz, referring to the term chromatin, which was itself introduced by Walther Flemming, who discovered cell division. Some of the early karyological terms have become outdated. For example, Chromatin (Flemming 1880) and Chromosom (Waldeyer 1888), both ascribe color to a non-colored state.
left.upper.bottom.column=A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle. This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation.

right.title=Science fact
right.upper.top.column=Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form). 
right.upper.bottom.column=Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation.

browse.edit.title=Administration page for human chromosomes
browse.first.p=The human chromosomes are numbered from 1 to 22, with two additional chromosomes called X and Y. Chromosomes 1\u201322 occur as two copies in every somatic cell. The X chromosome occurs as two copies in every female somatic cell, but only once in every male somatic cell. The Y chromosome occurs only once in every male somatic cell. Thus, the sex chromosomes in males are XY, and the sex chromosomes in females are XX. Altogether, human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). During mitosis, the genome condenses to form chromosomes that can be seen using a light microscope.

browse.last.p=In a point in the cell cycle, that is, during metaphase, each of the chromosomes can be seen to have two arms, the p arm and the q arm. The letter p refers to the short arm, while q refers to the long arm. Within each arm, numbers are assigned to large areas called regions, and another set of numbers is used to refer to bands within the regions. Numbering starts from the centromere, and increases as one moves towards the tip of each arm. To provide an example, the term \u201C14q32\u201D refers to the second band in the third region of the q arm of chromosome 14.

dna.title=Structure of DNA molecule
dna.text.upper=Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides.

'DNA'. Basic Biology. Archived from the original on 5 January 2017." href="#wikidna">2a</a>]
dna.text.lower=Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phospho-diester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine (in RNA the thymine base is substituted by Uracil [U]) and cytosine and the purines are adenine and guanine. Unlike DNA molecule the RNA molecule is single stranded.
