about=About the page
about.paragraph1=The web location deals with the topic of human chromosomes, i.e. the human karyotype. It describes the set of all chromosomes and some of the genes located on each of them. Conditions associated with different genes and changes in them are also described. A certain analytical methodology is also mentioned here. Of course in a volume and manner that is relatively accessible to all readers.
about.paragraph2=This website is made exclusively for educational and informational purposes. All sources used are listed in the text and references in the footnote of the page. In addition to the content that can be seen on these pages, there are two access points that provide relevant information regarding chromosomes in <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">JSON</span> format (rest endpoints) and can be found at the following links: <ul class="restpoints jumbotron mb-5 mt-5"><li>list of all chromosomes and described loci with associated link to each chromosome. ( <a class="font-italic" target="_blank" href="/chromosomes/list-all">/chromosomes/list-all</a> )</li><li>information on individual chromosomes ( /chromosomes/get-chromosome/{id} )</li>, where the parameter {id} represents a number from 1 to 24.

dna.extraction.title=DNA extraction
dna.extraction.paragraph1=To begin working with DNA we have to first isolate it. The first isolation of DNA was done in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher.[<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dahm R (January 2008). 'Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research'. Human Genetics. 122 (6): 565\u201381"  href="#extraction">7</a>] Currently it is a routine procedure in molecular biology or forensic analyses. For the chemical method, there are many different kits used for extraction, and selecting the correct one will save time on kit optimization and extraction procedures.

dna.extraction.paragraph3.title=Types of extraction
dna.extraction.paragraph3=<strong class="btn btn-warning  font-weight-bold">Organic extraction</strong> involves the addition of and incubation in multiple different chemical solutions [<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Elkins KM (2013). 'DNA Extraction. Forensic DNA Biology'. pp.\u00A039\u201352" href="#extraction">7a</a>], including a lysis step, a phenol chloroform extraction, an ethanol precipitation, and washing steps. Organic extraction is often used in laboratories because it is cheap, and it yields large quantities of pure DNA.
dna.extraction.paragraph4=<strong class="btn btn-warning  font-weight-bold">Chelex extraction</strong> method involves adding the Chelex resin to the sample, boiling the solution, then vortexing and centrifuging it. The cellular materials bind to the Chelex beads, while the DNA is available in the supernatant (upper leyer of solution acfter centrifugating).[<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Butler JM (2005). 'Forensic DNA typing: biology, technology and genetics of STR markers' (2nd edition). Amsterdam: Elsevier Academic Press" href="#extraction">7b</a>] The Chelex method is much faster and simpler than organic extraction, and it only requires one tube, which decreases the risk of DNA contamination but it yealds much lower quantity of DNA.
dna.extraction.paragraph5=<strong class="btn btn-warning font-weight-bold">Solid phase extraction</strong> such as using a spin-column based extraction method takes advantage of the fact that DNA binds to silica gel. The sample containing DNA is added to a column containing a silica gel or silica beads and chaotropic salts. The chaotropic salts disrupt the hydrogen bonding between strands and facilitate binding of the DNA to silica by causing the nucleic acids to become hydrophobic. This exposes the phosphate residues so they are available for adsorption.[<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Li, Richard (11 March 2015). 'Forensic biology' (2nd ed.). Boca Raton." href="#extraction">7c</a>] The DNA binds to the silica, while the rest of the solution is washed out using ethanol to remove chaotropic salts and other unnecessary constituents.[<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Elkins KM (2013). 'DNA Extraction. Forensic DNA Biology.' pp. 39\u201352." href="#extraction">7d</a>] The DNA can then be rehydrated with aqueous low salt solutions allowing for elution of the DNA from the beads.

dna.banding.title=Giemsa staining - G banding
dna.banding.paragraph1=Before chromosomes can be stained using G banding technique we have to cultivate cells from which we will get chromosomes in condensed state. Sample cells can be any somatic cell (peripheral blood, bone marrow, epithelial cells etc.). Cell culture involves 24 h or 48 h incubation at 37&#176;C in RPMI 1640 medium, enriched with 25% fetal bovine serum and 0.002M L-glutamine. Cultivation of cells sample is done in nutrient medium and then their cell division cycles are stopped and after that chromosomes are stained. Chromosomes are captured in metaphase of mitosis (cell division) by using some cytostatic like colchicine  or colcemide.
dna.banding.paragraph2=G banding or Giemsa banding is a technique used in cytogenetics to produce a visible karyotype (group of all chromosomes) by staining condensed chromosomes. The preparations are stained with a 2% solution of Giemsa in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 3 minutes. It is useful for identifying genetic diseases through the photographic representation of the entire chromosome complement.[<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Speicher, Michael R. and Nigel P. Carter. 'The New Cytogenetics: Blurring the Boundaries with Molecular Biology.' Nature Reviews Genetics, Vol 6. Oct 2005." href="#banding">8</a>] The metaphase chromosomes are treated with trypsin (to partially digest the histones - proteins that envelope chromosome) and stained with Giemsa stain. Heterochromatic regions, which tend to be rich with adenine and thymine (AT-rich) DNA and relatively gene-poor, stain more darkly in G-banding. In contrast, less condensed chromatin (Euchromatin)\u2014which tends to be rich with guanine and cytosine (GC-rich) and more transcriptionally active\u2014incorporates less Giemsa stain, and these regions appear as light bands in G-banding. The pattern of bands are numbered on each arm of the chromosome from the centromere to the telomere. This numbering system allows any band on the chromosome to be identified and described precisely.[<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Nussbaum, Robert; McInnes, Roderick; Willard, Huntington (2015). Thompson & Thompson, 'Genetics in Medicine' (Eighth ed.). Canada: Elsevier Inc. p.58." href="#banding">8a</a>]

left.title=History fact
left.upper.top.column=The word chromosome comes from the Greek word (chroma, "colour") and (soma, "body"), describing their strong staining by particular dyes. The term was coined by the german scientist von Waldeyer-Hartz, referring to the term chromatin, which was itself introduced by Walther Flemming, who discovered cell division. Some of the early karyological terms have become outdated. For example, Chromatin (Flemming 1880) and Chromosom (Waldeyer 1888), both ascribe color to a non-colored state.
left.upper.bottom.column=A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle. This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation.

right.upper.bottom.column=Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation.

browse.first.p=The human chromosomes are numbered from 1 to 22, with two additional chromosomes called X and Y. Chromosomes 1\u201322 occur as two copies in every somatic cell. The X chromosome occurs as two copies in every female somatic cell, but only once in every male somatic cell. The Y chromosome occurs only once in every male somatic cell. Thus, the sex chromosomes in males are XY, and the sex chromosomes in females are XX. Altogether, human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). During mitosis, the genome condenses to form chromosomes that can be seen using a light microscope.

browse.last.p=In a point in the cell cycle, that is, during metaphase, each of the chromosomes can be seen to have two arms, the p arm and the q arm. The letter p refers to the short arm, while q refers to the long arm. Within each arm, numbers are assigned to large areas called regions, and another set of numbers is used to refer to bands within the regions. Numbering starts from the centromere, and increases as one moves towards the tip of each arm. To provide an example, the term \u201C14q32\u201D refers to the second band in the third region of the q arm of chromosome 14.

dna.title=Structure of DNA molecule
dna.text.upper=Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides.

'DNA'. Basic Biology. Archived from the original on 5 January 2017." href="#wikidna">2a</a>]
dna.text.lower=Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phospho-diester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine (in RNA the thymine base is substituted by Uracil [U]) and cytosine and the purines are adenine and guanine. Unlike DNA molecule the RNA molecule is single stranded.

methodology.first.paragraph=Until 1920, the methodology commonly used for chromosomal analysis was based on tissue fixation in Carnoy-Flemming solution, preparation of microtomic sections by paraffin process, and staining the preparations with iron hematoxylin. Many of these chromosomal analyzes were performed on testicular tissue taken from patients with tuberculosis of the epididymis or from executed criminals. Therefore, it seems likely that the processing of these tissues by fixation, dehydration, paraffining, and high temperatures as well as posthumous changes, played an important role in modulating the variability of the results of chromosomal analysis. These methods provided insight into "mitotic figures", with a significant overlap of chromosomes in the dense metaphase plate and a low level of differentiation of their morphology. It is therefore not surprising that scientists of the time had different ideas about the number of human chromosomes. In 1955, Tjio and Levan published a paper with the exact number of human chromosomes (2n = 46) based on the culture of embryonic lung cells.
methodology.second.paragraph=During the second half of the 20th century, in less than 50 years, there have been two revolutions in biology one in protein biochemistry followed by one in molecular genetics with major repercussions both for fundamental research and medical applications. The development of protein biochemistry (at the end of the 1950s) has led to the purification of many proteins followed by the study using crystallography of their three-dimensional structure and, in parallel with this, their sequencing (identification of the linking of amino acids). [<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Diagnostic Techniques in Genetics, Jean-Louis Serre, Isabelle Heath, Simon Heath, Wiley (23 October, 2006)" href="#technics">6</a>]
methodology.third.paragraph=The consequences of the second revolution \u2013 in molecular genetics \u2013 have been more important in the domain of fundamental research than in its applications, simply because it gives direct access to the genes which direct biological phenomenon whereas before it was only possible, at best, to access their products or just the phenotypic perturbations of the phenomena resulting from mutations. Molecular genetics has allowed the cloning of genes, their sequencing and, above all, the ability to isolate them in vitro, in vectors, to modify them in a targeted manner, and to reintroduce them into cells or organisms to study, in a controlled manner, the way in which they control one or other aspect of a phenomenon. Genetics, in becoming molecular, has very rapidly become an integral part of most biological fields, not only due to its power to dissect a biological phenomenon but also because of its increasing ability to unify disciplines which had previously appeared different or unrelated. [<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Diagnostic Techniques in Genetics, Jean-Louis Serre, Isabelle Heath, Simon Heath, Wiley (23 October, 2006)" href="#technics">6</a>]
methodology.fourth.paragraph=For diagnosis, molecular biologists mostly study and manipulate DNA, but RNA can also be studied, for example in virology where the genomes of many viruses are made of RNA. There are several different divisions of the analysis and testing methods of human chromosomes themselves. Several methods that fall into the domain of cytogenetics and molecular genetics will be briefly described on this site. These methods are as follows:
